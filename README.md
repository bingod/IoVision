IoVision
========

IoVision a simple markdown blog platform written in python. Pretty much like Octopress, however, this one is quite lightweight, Only several python files.

Maybe most of you are tired of the running your own blogs. Whatever, if you have heard of github pages, it could be a little bit simple. A lot of people blogging with Jekyll on github which provides free host space and custom url binding service, but I do not think it is a good idea for those who are not familiar with command lines. As a Computer Science major student, I almost spent a whole afternoon to run Octopress on my PC successfully. The cost is so expensive that not all the people like to waste time on that thing. 

For now, that's it, transform your plain text into static websites and blogs with this project. This is not only for writting blogs, however, helps you push the blogs to the github pages.
